# Russian Strife

***Russian Strife*** is a Russian-language *DOOM*-engine source port based on version 3.0.0 of [Chocolate Doom](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom) and made entirely for the game *Strife: Quest for the Sigil*. The port’s main purpose is to present a Russian translation and voiceover of *Strife* on a vanilla-based Doom engine.

The port is made in the same spirit as *[Russian Doom](https://github.com/JNechaevsky/russian-doom)*, creation of Julian Nechaevsky, a port that fulfills the same purpose and supports other games released on the *Doom* engine. With the author displaying more interest toward the games that his port already supports, I have made it my goal to use *Chocolate Doom* as a base for porting my own translation of *Strife*, now accessible as part of the port [GZDoom](https://zdoom.org/index) and as part of the project “[Russian translation of GZDoom](https://github.com/Nemrtvi/gzdoom-russian-translation)” (containing extra resources that do not appear in GZDoom).

In contrast to *Russian Doom*, this source port does not offer any extra gameplay functions and treats (e.g. brightmaps, HUD customization, any extra gameplay changes), and, at this time, does not support language switching between Russian and English (as far as text goes—the original English voiceover can be used with minor misalignments). The only change in the engine that affects the course of gameplay are adjusted cutscene timings, specifically made for the Russian voiceover that comes with the port.

The translation in *Russian Strife* is mainly based on the Russian GZDoom translation, made by me and the translators of the *[Arch-Heretics](https://vk.com/archheretics)* team—with a bit of help from Julian Nechaevsky—and the creators of the [previous translation of *Strife*](http://arc.iddqd.ru/14072015/viewtopic.php?t=5331): Ameba, theleo_ua and bed.intruder. The aforementioned individuals have given their permission for me to use their materials in *Russian Strife*.
